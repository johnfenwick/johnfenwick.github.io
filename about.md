# Hi, I'm a student learning iOS development.

I'm actually a musician by education and trade, finally tackling my fears to chase my passion of software development.

My preferred language is Ruby for it's ease of use and flexibility. I also have experience with HTML, CSS, and bash; with dabblings in JavaScript, Python, and Swift.

I'm currently learning iOS development through Ohio State University.
